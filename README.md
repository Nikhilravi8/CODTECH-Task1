**Overview of the Project**

**Project:**
Password Strength Checker is a tool designed to assess the strength of user passwords by analyzing their length, complexity, entropy, and susceptibility to common patterns or dictionary attacks. The tool provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive password strength evaluation system that ensures users create secure, difficult-to-crack passwords by considering a variety of metrics such as length, character variety, entropy, and pattern detection.

**Key Activities:**
**Password Input Validation:**
User inputs a password for evaluation.
**Length and Complexity Analysis:**
Check for the presence of lowercase, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Assess the password length to determine if it meets basic security requirements (e.g., minimum 8 or 12 characters).
**Entropy Calculation:**
Calculate the passwordâ€™s entropy based on the variety of characters used and the length, indicating the difficulty of guessing the password.
**Pattern and Dictionary Detection:**
Detect common patterns such as repeated characters, sequences, or known keyboard patterns like "qwerty."
Check against a list of common, weak passwords to avoid.
**Strength Evaluation:**
Uses a scoring system to evaluate the password's strength based on complexity, entropy, and pattern detection results.
**User Feedback:**
Provides real-time feedback on how to improve password strength by addressing specific issues such as lack of character variety, too short length, or predictable patterns.

**Technologies Used:**
Regular Expressions (re): Used for pattern matching and checking the presence of specific character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters).
Math Library (math): For entropy calculation, especially logarithmic functions used to assess the complexity of the password based on the character pool.
